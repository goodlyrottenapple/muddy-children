# DEAK-calculus-tool
This is the compiled version of the D.EAK calculus using the Calculus toolbox. No Isabelle installation is required.

Requires scala and java to be installed though.


To run, navigate to the project folder in terminal and run `./build.py` to compile the scala classes. Once compiled, run `make gui`.
